New Version:
Code the Stars is a non-profit organization that aims to make tools, host events, and empower young coders. We have hosted hackathons, run events, and are working on tools for young coders.

Code the Stars was founded by coders who loved the art but were frusterated by the low amount of resources available to young coders. That thought resulted in this organization run by these coders to make a difference to bridge that gap and allow young coders to embark on this magical journey without hitting these roadblocks that hindered their growth. 

# What we do

We run events where young coders can collaborate on projects, share ideas, and learn from each others, for free! 
We make tools to help the community that the community can build and improve! (Note: Tools are not released yet)
We are always cooking up some cool things for young hackers - check back later!
